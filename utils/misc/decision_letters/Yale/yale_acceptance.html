        <p style="font-weight:600">Dear,</p>
        <p>Welcome to Yale College! It is with the greatest enthusiasm that I write to congratulate you on your admission to the Class of 2029. The world has never been more in need of intelligent, strong, committed, energetic, and visionary young people. I am delighted that we have chosen you to be among those at Yale, and I hope you will join our community next fall.
        <br>
        <br>
        For over three hundred years, Yale's motto "Lux et Veritas" - "Light and Truth" - has guided Yale students, faculty, and alumni in their pursuit of knowledge and leadership. As a Yale student you will engage astonishing intellectual, cultural, and scientific resources. Your Yale education will equip you with the knowledge and wisdom to make an impact in any field, anywhere in the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Yale experience is shaped by the people who make up its community. It is a place of belonging, respect, and friendship, where diversity and fellowship reinforce each other. I know who your fellow students will be, and I am confident you will not find in one place a more diverse, talented, and aspiring company of peers.
        <br>
        <br>
        I recognize that this news is accompanied by the challenge of choosing your new home without the benefit of visiting this spring. Although I wish you could meet your new classmates and bond with the Yale community on campus, hundreds of your peers are ready to connect on digital platforms. Please join the 3o Bulldog Days of April at admissions,yale.edu/admits all month long.
        <br>
        <br>
        When you are ready, please reply to our offer of admission by completing the online reply form on your status portal. We ask that you reply by May 1, but if you require more time to reach your decision you may contact us to request an extension. If you have any questions please email <a href="bulldog@yale.edu">bulldog@yale.edu</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        We hope that you will choose to join us at Yale, and we look forward to celebrating your unique contribution to the University's traditions, life, and mission. It is clear from your application that you are a person who lives for challenge, for excellence, and for making a difference in the world. Congratulations again on your achievements so far. We look forward to what is still to come.
        </p>

        <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>

        <div style="flex: 1;">
            <p>Thanks for reading until the end ️️️️!</p>

            <p>Anyways, most important thing is you are taking a step closer to your goals. </p>
            
            <p>One year from now, you could be reading a real acceptance letter just like this one. Every study session, every project completed, every challenge overcome brings you closer to your goals. Continue to dedicate yourself to excellence, and doors will open that you never imagined possible.</p>
            
            <p>Your educational journey is just beginning. Dream big, work hard, and remember that today's preparation determines tomorrow's achievement.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,
