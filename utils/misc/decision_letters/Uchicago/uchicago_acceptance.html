            It is my great pleasure to inform you that you have been admitted to the University of Chicago's Class of 2029. With your exceptional academic record, strong voice, and impressive accomplishments, you have distinguished yourself in one of the largest and most competitive applicant pools.
        </p>

We imagine you in our laboratories and on our performance stages, in our libraries and on our athletic fields, immersed in your passions and engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. As part of our College Houses, you will cultivate lifelong friendships; in our classrooms, you will create and inhabit a vibrant intellectual space with your peers and professors.</p>
        <p>
            In the coming weeks, I invite you to explore all that Chicago has to offer.

The enclosed information provides details about how to arrange your visit and confirm your enrollment at Chicago. We look forward to receiving your reply as soon as you are ready-but no later than May 1, 2025.
