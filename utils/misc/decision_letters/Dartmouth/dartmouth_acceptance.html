        <p style="font-weight:600">Dear,</p>
        <p>
            I am honored to offer you admission to the Class of 2029 at Dartmouth College. You offered an impressive application for us to consider, and I invite you to join the Class of 2029.
        </p>
        <p>Your admission to the College reflects our confidence in your outstanding record of academic and personal achievement. You will add an important voice to Dartmouth's undergraduate community, and we look forward to welcoming you to the College on the Hill as we begin our 256th academic year next fall.</p>
        <p>
            Our offer of early admission is made with the expectation that you will maintain the level of academic and personal excellence that characterized your candidacy. Accordingly, we will carefully review your performance during the remainder of your senior year, and we ask that your mid-year and final grades be forwarded to the Office of Admissions as soon as they become available, but no later than June 30.
            <br> <br>
            Under the binding terms of our Early Decision plan, please withdraw any applications you may
have filed with other colleges and do not initiate any new ones. To confirm your place in the Class of 2028, please complete the online enrollment form by May 1. Rather than a deposit of money, it is the integrity of your (electronic) signature that holds your place in entering class. In the meantime, please contact us if we can be of any help to you. You can reach
us at (603) 646-2875.
        </p>
        <p>
            Congratulations, again, on your acceptance to the Class of 2029. Start connecting with
your future classmates by using # Dartmouth29s on social media, and by joining Dartmouth's Class of 2029 Facebook Group.
        </p>
        <p>Welcome to Dartmouth!</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <div style="flex: 1;">
            <p>Thanks for reading until the end</p>

            <p>Anyways, most important thing is you are taking a step closer to your goals. </p>
            
            <p>One year from now, you could be reading a real acceptance letter just like this one. Every study session, every project completed, every challenge overcome brings you closer to your goals. Continue to dedicate yourself to excellence, and doors will open that you never imagined possible.</p>
            
            <p>Your educational journey is just beginning. Dream big, work hard, and remember that today's preparation determines tomorrow's achievement.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,
