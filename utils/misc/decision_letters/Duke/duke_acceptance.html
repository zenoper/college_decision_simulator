        <p style="font-weight:600">Dear,</p>
        <p>Congratulations! I am delighted to offer you admission to the Class of 2027 at Duke University.</p>
        <p>
            Your many successes inside and outside the classroom have earned you a place among the world's best students. This was an extraordinary year for us - we received almost 50,000 applications for just 2500 places in the first year class. The students we have admitted come from across the country and around the world, and will bring together a fascinating variety of talents, interests, and experiences. You and your classmates can expect to be challenged intellectually, form enduring bonds of friendship and community, and share in the excitement of discovery that pervades our campus.
        </p>
        <p>While we regret that circumstances beyond our control have prevented us from offering on-campus events for admitted students, in the coming weeks you will hear from many members of the Duke community describing the qualities that make Duke a unique community and an exceptional education. We know you'll find this information interesting and useful, and you should feel free to ask us any questions you might have.</p>
        <p>
            To become a member of the Class of 2027, please click on the "Respond to Offer" link above, and follow the listed instructions to accept our offer. You must respond by 11:59 p.m. on May 1, 2023, in order to hold your place in the entering class; we do not require a monetary deposit. If you must decline this offer, please be sure to respond online so our records will be accurate.
            <br> <br>
            While we are currently unable to mail the packet of information we typically send to admitted students, in the coming days we will make all of that information available to you online. That will include Duke's Community Standard as well as instructions and information regarding housing, tuition and financial aid, dining, and other campus services. Please read this material carefully. Soon after you accept our offer of admission, you will receive a digital Blue Book containing detailed instructions for your enrollment and arrival at Duke.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, please don't forget what it took to get you to this point; we fully expect you to maintain high standards of academic performance and personal behavior in and out of school, including abiding by our Community Standard. If the information in your application changes - including academic, personal, disciplinary, or legal matters - you must contact me directly within 48 hours. We reserve the right to withdraw our offer of admission should your standing in any of these areas change, if you do not notify me promptly, or if you do not meet the terms of the Community Standard between now and the beginning of our fall term.
        </p>
        <p>You have my warmest congratulations on your admission to Duke. We look forward to having you among us this fall.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
